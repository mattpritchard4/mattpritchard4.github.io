The site has multiple pages and several stateful components. After recognizing the benefits of type systems in modern programming languages, I converted several of the React components to ReasonML (OCaml) and leveraged the BuckleScript compiler to generate type safe JavaScript code that works in tandem with the existing ReactJS codebase."
